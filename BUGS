COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
This section documents incompatibilites between Anarki and Arc2.
See also the CONVENTIONS file.

The current thinking is that new macros generally don't need to be
mentioned here. It should be understood that defining new macros could
potentially break code. To get a list of the added macros in Anarki,
use: (load "lib/new-macros.arc") (new-macros)

*2007/02/19* When loading lib/defpat.arc, the symbol p-m can't be safely
 used as a variable for a container, or as the symbol for a function.  This
 problem will also apply for any macro defined in Anarki that is not
 already defined in Arc1.

ARC# ISSUES
 This section documents bugs in the official Arc distribution. They are 
 also present in Anarki unless otherwise noted.

*2008/02/29* `markdown` does not wrap the body of text immediately after
 a <pre> block with the <p> tag.

*2007/02/19* Macros will override local variables in (let ...) and other
 local-variable-creating forms.

*2007/02/18* Interpreter reads ".a" as the EOF character. 
 Arc1 treats EOF as an error, which this probably should be anyway.
 However, Anarki quits on EOF. This also applies to things like "is!:.a",
 which should arguably be equivalent to "(is ': a)".
 UPDATE: Other surprise EOFs include "\!". Still present in Arc2.
