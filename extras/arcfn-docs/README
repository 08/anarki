This directory generates the Arc documentation as seen at http://arcfn.com/doc

To run:
$ mkdir html

Run arc startup script
> (load "template.arc")
> (runall)
after this, you can regenerate a single file:
> (run "time.tem")

The .tem files are the templates that generate the html files.

The generated html files go into the html directory.

This is unsupported, and is put in anarki in the hopes that it will be
helpful to someone.
