This file details the conventions for code that's pushed to Anarki.
Because anyone can push code, it's important to keep the style as
clean and uniform as possible, so that the underlying code can be more
easily understood.

GIT
  The first line of a commit message should function like the
  "Subject:" header of an email. It's assumed to be the title of the
  commit; any further description should be put after the first
  line. This means that you should *not*:
    * Put part of a sentence on the first line and continue it in the
      rest of the patch.
    * Put a long, verbose description of the patch on the first line.

  When you try to git-push changes, you may get a message to the
  effect that the remote repository contains changes that aren't in
  your local repository. If you just git-pull and merge the changes,
  you get an unsightly commit saying "Merged with origin." To avoid
  this, use git-rebase instead. This will merge your local repo with
  the remote one in such a way that there's no monolithic merge stage
  that needs to be recorded.
