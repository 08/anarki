This directory contains defenses for why "arc-f is the way it is".

There are many paths to programming language design.  From the
point of view of starting a new language, we can glimpse, a
little, which path may, or may not, be promising.  But we can
only glimpse; the truth may only be discovered, for certain, by
actually entering the path.

In many ways, some decisions end up being arbitrary.  The exact
tradeoffs between competing possibilities may not be very clear,
or may be small enough to potentially be in the noise.
